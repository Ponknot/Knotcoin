# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The latest release is always the supported version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability — especially one that could allow:
- Creating coins from nothing (inflation bug)
- Stealing someone else's funds
- Breaking the consensus mechanism
- Crashing nodes remotely

**Do not post it publicly.**

Contact options (in order of preference):
1. Open a GitHub Security Advisory (private): Repository → Security → Advisories → New
2. If GitHub advisories aren't available, encrypt and email the details

A good vulnerability report includes:
- What the bug is
- How to reproduce it
- What an attacker could do with it
- If you have a fix, include it

There is no bug bounty program and no paid security team.
This is open source software under the MIT license.
If you find a critical bug, fixing it is its own reward — and the community's gratitude.
