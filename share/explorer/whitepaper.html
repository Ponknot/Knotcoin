     ABSTRACT

  <div class="abstract">
    <div class="abstract-label">Abstract</div>
    <p>A purely peer-to-peer electronic cash system can be made resistant to quantum computing without relying on any
      algebraic assumption. We present Knotcoin, a digital currency whose security depends on lattice-based cryptography
      and hash functions &mdash; both resistant to quantum attacks. The system uses Dilithium3, a stateless lattice-based
      signature scheme standardized by NIST, to authorize transactions and a memory-hard proof-of-work algorithm called
      PONC (Proof of Network Confidence) to achieve distributed consensus. A built-in referral mechanism creates direct
      economic incentive for network growth without introducing multi-level structures or governance manipulation. The
      result is a payment network that can be deployed once and requires no ongoing maintenance, no privileged
      administrator, and no central infrastructure to operate indefinitely.</p>
  </div>


  <!-- ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
     1. INTRODUCTION
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">1.</span>Introduction</h2>

  <p>The problem with existing electronic cash systems is not that they fail today, but that they will fail tomorrow.
    Bitcoin demonstrated that a decentralised network of nodes can maintain a shared ledger without trusting any
    individual participant. Its proof-of-work mechanism, combined with ECDSA digital signatures, has operated without
    interruption since January 2009. That is a remarkable engineering achievement.</p>

  <p>But the cryptographic foundation has a known expiration date. Shor's algorithm, running on a sufficiently powerful
    quantum computer, can derive an ECDSA private key from its public key in polynomial time. The public keys of Bitcoin
    addresses are exposed the moment they spend funds. Every spent Bitcoin address is a future target. This is not
    speculation &mdash; it is mathematics waiting for hardware.</p>

  <p>The conventional response has been lattice-based cryptography, standardised by NIST in 2024 (CRYSTALS-Kyber,
    Dilithium). These schemes work. They are fast. But their security rests on the assumed hardness of structured
    lattice problems &mdash; an assumption less than three decades old. We have bet on algebraic hardness assumptions
    before. We have lost those bets before.</p>

  <p>There is a simpler path.</p>

  <p>Hash functions are the oldest and most conservative tools in cryptography. Their security derives from the
    difficulty of finding collisions and preimages &mdash; a problem for which quantum computers offer only Grover's
    algorithm, providing a square root speedup. A 256-bit hash retains 128 bits of effective security against any known
    quantum algorithm. That is sufficient.</p>

  <p>Knotcoin takes this path. Every cryptographic operation &mdash; signing, verification, address derivation, block
    hashing, proof-of-work &mdash; is constructed from hash functions and nothing else. If hash functions are sound,
    Knotcoin is sound. If hash functions somehow fail, all of modern computing fails with them, and we have larger
    problems than money.</p>

  <p>The second design goal is permanence. Knotcoin is built to be deployed and left alone. No foundation. No team. No
    administrator. The rules are fixed in the genesis block, enforced independently by every node, and alterable only
    through a narrow governance mechanism designed to handle genuine cryptographic emergencies. The creator mines the
    first block under the same rules as everyone else, and then the protocol belongs to whoever runs it.</p>

  <p>The third goal is fair access. Bitcoin mining is dominated by specialised hardware that costs millions. An ordinary
    person cannot meaningfully participate. Knotcoin uses a memory-hard proof-of-work puzzle designed to reduce the gap
    between consumer and datacenter hardware. A laptop competes. The advantage ratio across CPU tiers is single-digit,
    compared to Bitcoin's million-fold ASIC advantage. Mining is meant to be something anyone can do.</p>


  <!-- ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
     2. THE PROBLEM
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">2.</span>The Problem</h2>

  <p>Consider what a peer-to-peer electronic cash system needs to survive for a hundred years:</p>

  <ol type="a">
    <li>Its signatures must withstand quantum computers.</li>
    <li>Its consensus must not require specialised hardware.</li>
    <li>Its rules must not depend on any individual or group.</li>
    <li>Its network must grow without central coordination.</li>
    <li>Its supply must be scarce without being manipulable.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>No existing system satisfies all five conditions simultaneously. Bitcoin satisfies (c) and (e) well. It fails (a)
    entirely and (b) in practice. Network growth (d) is not incentivised at the protocol level &mdash; it depends on
    external market dynamics. Proof-of-stake systems satisfy (b) but struggle with (c) because large stakeholders
    accumulate governance power proportional to wealth, which concentrates over time.</p>

  <p>Knotcoin is designed to satisfy all five conditions with the simplest possible mechanisms. Where we had to choose
    between cleverness and robustness, we chose robustness.</p>


  <!-- ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
     3. TRANSACTIONS
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">3.</span>Transactions</h2>

  <p>A Knotcoin transaction is a signed instruction to transfer value from one address to another. It contains the
    sender's address and public key, the recipient's address, the amount in knots (the smallest unit &mdash; one hundred
    million knots per KOT), a sequential nonce, a fee, and a Dilithium3 signature.</p>

  <div class="fig">TRANSACTION STRUCTURE
    +-----------+----------+-----------+--------+--------+------+-------+
    | sender | sender | recipient | amount | fee |nonce | sig |
    | address | pubkey | address |(knots) |(knots) | | |
    +-----------+----------+-----------+--------+--------+------+-------+
    | 32 bytes | 1952 B | 32 bytes | 8 B | 8 B | 8 B |~3309B |
    +-----------+----------+-----------+--------+--------+------+-------+</div>
  <p class="fig-caption">Fig. 1 &mdash; Transaction format. Total size approximately 5.4 KB, dominated by the Dilithium3
    signature.</p>

  <p>Validation is straightforward. The sender's public key must hash to their claimed address. The signature must
    verify under that public key. The nonce must be exactly one greater than the sender's current nonce, preventing
    replay. The sender must have sufficient balance to cover both the transfer amount and the fee. The fee must be at
    least one knot.</p>

  <p>A user's referrer is a permanent record stored in account state, set once at the time of a wallet's first outbound
    transaction. It is not carried in every subsequent transaction. The first outbound transaction from any address may
    include an optional referrer address in a dedicated registration field; all later transactions from that address
    omit it entirely. If no referrer is specified in the first transaction, the address is marked as self-referred and
    receives no referral bonus.</p>

  <p>If a transaction is broadcast but remains unconfirmed &mdash; for example because the fee was set too low during a
    period of congestion &mdash; the sender may broadcast a replacement carrying the same nonce and a fee at least ten
    percent higher. Nodes accept the replacement, evict the lower-fee transaction from the mempool, and relay the
    replacement to peers. This prevents an account's nonce from becoming permanently blocked by a stranded low-fee
    transaction.</p>

  <h3>3.1 Signatures: Dilithium3</h3>

  <p>Dilithium is a lattice-based signature scheme standardized by NIST in 2024 (FIPS 204). We use the Dilithium3 parameter
    set, which provides NIST Security Level 3 (equivalent to AES-192 against quantum attacks).</p>

  <p><em>Why Dilithium rather than SPHINCS+.</em> Both are quantum-resistant and NIST-standardized. Dilithium produces
    significantly smaller signatures (3.3 KB vs 7.8 KB), reducing blockchain bandwidth by 58%. This matters for a
    peer-to-peer network where every byte must be transmitted and stored by thousands of nodes. Dilithium is also
    faster: signing takes ~1ms vs ~50ms for SPHINCS+, and verification is similarly accelerated.</p>

  <p>Dilithium is stateless. Every signing operation is self-contained. You can restore a wallet from a seed phrase after
    ten years, sign a transaction on a different continent, and nothing breaks. There is no counter. There is no state
    to lose.</p>

  <p>The tradeoff is larger keys: public keys are 1,952 bytes and secret keys are 4,032 bytes. We accept this cost.
    Keys are stored once; signatures are transmitted constantly. Optimizing for signature size is the correct choice
    for blockchain efficiency.</p>

  <h3>3.2 Addresses</h3>

  <p>An address is the first 32 bytes of SHA-512(public_key), encoded in base32 with a "KOT1" prefix and a four-byte
    checksum suffix.</p>

  <p>The address hides the public key until the first spending transaction. For unspent addresses, even a quantum
    attacker cannot derive the key because they have only a hash &mdash; and finding a preimage of SHA-512 is
    computationally infeasible even for quantum computers.</p>

  <p>After spending, the public key is revealed on-chain. But Dilithium signatures are quantum-resistant, so key exposure
    does not create a vulnerability. The hash serves as an additional conservative layer, not the primary defence.</p>


  <!-- ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
     4. BLOCKS
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">4.</span>Blocks</h2>

  <p>Blocks are produced every 60 seconds. A block consists of a header and an ordered list of transactions.</p>

  <div class="fig">BLOCK HEADER (148 bytes)
    +--------+-----------+--------+------+--------+-------+-------+-------+
    |version |prev_hash |merkle |time |diff |nonce |height |miner |
    | | |root |stamp |target | | |addr |
    +--------+-----------+--------+------+--------+-------+-------+-------+
    | 4 B | 32 B | 32 B | 4 B | 32 B | 8 B | 4 B | 32 B |
    +--------+-----------+--------+------+--------+-------+-------+-------+</div>
  <p class="fig-caption">Fig. 2 &mdash; Block header layout.</p>

  <p>The target block size is 50 kilobytes. Given the approximately 7.8 KB transaction size, each block holds roughly
    six transactions. This is deliberately small.</p>

  <p>Knotcoin's Layer 1 is a settlement layer. It is not designed to carry every coffee purchase. Daily payments happen
    on Layer 2 state channels (Section 9). Layer 1 records channel openings, closings, and dispute resolutions. Six
    settlements per minute is more than sufficient for this purpose.</p>

  <p>The block size can be increased up to 500 KB by governance vote but can never be reduced below 50 KB. The ceiling
    exists to prevent runaway growth while allowing adaptation.</p>

  <h3>4.1 Merkle Tree</h3>

  <p>Transactions in each block are arranged in a binary Merkle tree using SHA3-256 as the hash function. This allows
    efficient transaction inclusion proofs &mdash; a property essential for light nodes (Section 8).</p>

  <p>Addresses use SHA-512 (SHA-2 family), while block hashing and Merkle trees use SHA3-256 (SHA-3 family). These are
    cryptographically independent constructions. A weakness in one does not imply a weakness in the other. This
    diversity is a considered defence-in-depth decision.</p>


  <!-- ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
     5. PROOF OF NETWORK CONFIDENCE
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">5.</span>Proof of Network Confidence</h2>

  <p>PONC is the consensus mechanism. Its purpose is identical to Bitcoin's proof-of-work: make it expensive to produce
    blocks and cheap to verify them, so that rewriting history requires an economically prohibitive commitment of
    resources.</p>

  <p>The difference is in what constitutes "work."</p>

  <h3>5.1 The Puzzle</h3>

  <p>Bitcoin's puzzle asks miners to find a SHA-256 hash below a target value. This operation is purely computational
    &mdash; it can be made arbitrarily fast by adding more logic gates, which is why ASICs dominate Bitcoin mining.</p>

  <p>PONC's puzzle adds a memory bottleneck. The miner cannot compute the hash without first filling and repeatedly
    reading from a 2-megabyte memory buffer. Memory latency is a bottleneck that custom silicon cannot fully eliminate,
    because DRAM physics are approximately equal across hardware platforms.</p>

  <p>The algorithm works in three stages:</p>

  <p><em>Stage 1: Fill a 2 MB scratchpad with pseudorandom data.</em> Start from a seed derived from the previous block
    hash and the miner's own address. Use SHA3-256 in counter mode to fill 65,536 chunks of 32 bytes each. This cost is
    paid once per new block template.</p>

  <p><em>Stage 2: Memory-hard hash loop.</em> Initialise a running state from the block header combined with the
    candidate nonce. Then perform 512 rounds: take the first 4 bytes of the state, use them as an index into the
    scratchpad, read the 32-byte chunk at that index, and hash the state together with the chunk. Each round reads from
    an unpredictable location in the scratchpad. The sequence of reads depends on the data itself &mdash; it cannot be
    precomputed or parallelised. The entire 2 MB scratchpad must remain in fast memory for the duration of the
    computation.</p>

  <p><em>Stage 3: Final hash.</em> The final state is hashed once more with SHA3-256. If the result is numerically below
    the current difficulty target, the block is valid. Otherwise, increment the nonce and return to Stage 2.</p>

    +------------------+</div>
  <p class="fig-caption">Fig. 3 &mdash; PONC mining procedure.</p>

  <h3>5.2 Hardware Fairness</h3>

  <p>Because the scratchpad is seeded by <code>SHA3-256(prev_block_hash || miner_address)</code>, every miner must
    compute a unique scratchpad personalised to their own address. This makes it impossible for a mining pool to
    distribute nonce work across workers sharing one scratchpad &mdash; each worker's memory buffer is bound to their
    address. Pools therefore operate by directing all participant hashpower through a single pool address. Users who
    wish to retain independent governance influence should mine under their own address rather than through a pool.</p>

  <p>The mining advantage ratio tells you how fair the system is:</p>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Hardware Comparison</th>
      <th>Approximate Ratio</th>
      <th>Outcome</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Bitcoin ASIC vs. laptop</td>
      <td>1,000,000 : 1</td>
      <td>Ordinary people cannot participate</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>High-end CPU vs. budget CPU</td>
      <td>3–8 : 1</td>
      <td>Consumer hardware competes meaningfully</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>High-end GPU vs. mid-range CPU</td>
      <td>50–150 : 1</td>
      <td>GPU mining exists and is advantageous</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Theoretical SRAM ASIC vs. CPU</td>
      <td>500–2,000 : 1</td>
      <td>Possible if coin value justifies manufacture</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>The bottleneck is memory read latency. DDR4 latency is roughly 50–80 nanoseconds whether it sits in a consumer
    laptop or a datacenter server. This keeps the CPU-to-CPU advantage ratio low. GPU mining carries a meaningful
    advantage because modern GPUs can run thousands of independent nonce attempts simultaneously, each occupying 2 MB of
    VRAM. The 50–150x figure is an honest bound, not a theoretical ceiling.</p>

  <p>ASIC resistance is a medium-term property. A 2 MB scratchpad can be implemented in on-chip SRAM on custom silicon
    &mdash; SRAM latency is 1–5 ns, ten to fifty times faster than DRAM. If Knotcoin achieves valuations that justify
    ASIC development, on-chip scratchpad caching becomes economically viable. Any response that changes scratchpad size
    would require a coordinated protocol upgrade, not a routine governance parameter change.</p>

  <p><strong>The PONC round count is tunable via governance vote</strong> (default 512 rounds, range 256-2048). As hardware improves over time, the network can increase the round count to maintain computational difficulty and preserve ASIC resistance without requiring a hard fork. This ensures the memory-hard properties remain effective across decades of hardware evolution.</p>

  <h3>5.3 Block Selection</h3>

  <p>Nodes follow the longest chain rule. If two valid blocks arrive at the same height, the chain with the greater
    cumulative difficulty wins. This is identical to Bitcoin.</p>


  <!-- ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
     6. DIFFICULTY ADJUSTMENT
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">6.</span>Difficulty Adjustment</h2>

  <p>The difficulty target is recalculated every 60 blocks (approximately one hour).</p>

  <div class="formula">
    expected = 3,600 seconds (60 blocks x 60 seconds each)<br>
    actual = time elapsed for the last 60 blocks<br>
    new_target = old_target x (actual / expected)
  </div>

  <p>Clamped: the target cannot change by more than a factor of 4 in a single adjustment period. This prevents timestamp
    manipulation attacks and ensures smooth difficulty transitions even under sudden hashrate changes.</p>

  <p>At genesis, difficulty is set low enough that a single consumer laptop produces a block within approximately 60
    seconds. As miners join, difficulty increases. As they leave, it decreases. The network self-regulates.</p>


  <!-- ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
     7. EMISSION
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">7.</span>Emission</h2>

  <p>Getting the money supply right is the hardest part of designing a currency. Knotcoin's emission has three phases.
  </p>

  <h3>7.1 Phase 1 &mdash; Bootstrap (First 6 Months)</h3>
  <p>Blocks 0 through 262,800.</p>

  <div class="formula">reward = 0.1 + 0.9 x (height / 262800) KOT</div>

  <p>The reward starts at 0.1 KOT and linearly increases to 1.0 KOT over six months. Very early miners earn less than
    miners who join a few months later. This is fair &mdash; the network is barely functional in its first days and
    early miners are taking the least risk because the coin is worthless. The increasing reward creates a positive
    incentive gradient. Mining becomes more rewarding over time during the bootstrap period, encouraging people to stay
    rather than try-and-leave.</p>

  <p>Total supply minted in Phase 1: approximately 144,540 KOT.</p>

  <h3>7.2 Phase 2 &mdash; Full Reward (Months 7 through 12)</h3>
  <p>Blocks 262,801 through 525,600.</p>

  <div class="formula">reward = 1.0 KOT per block</div>

  <p>Six months of stable, predictable rewards. This period establishes the economic baseline and gives the fee market
    time to develop. Total minted in Phase 2: approximately 262,800 KOT.</p>

  <h3>7.3 Phase 3 &mdash; Decay (Year 2 Onward)</h3>
  <p>Blocks 525,601 and all subsequent blocks.</p>

  <div class="formula">
    adjusted = block_height - 525601<br>
    reward = 1.0 / log<sub>2</sub>(adjusted + 2) KOT
  </div>

  <p>The formula is designed for continuity: at block 525,601, adjusted equals zero, and the reward is
    <code>1.0 / log<sub>2</sub>(2) = 1.000 KOT</code> &mdash; exactly matching the final Phase 2 reward. There is no
    step at the transition.
  </p>

  <p>The curve is steep near its origin. In the first weeks of Phase 3, rewards decline rapidly; by year 2, the annual
    rate of decline has slowed to low single digits. Miners and developers should understand this shape honestly: the
    fee market must begin functioning early in Phase 3, not at some distant future point. Layer 1 channel-operation fees
    must be generating meaningful miner income before the end of year 2. Unlike Bitcoin's sharp halvings &mdash; a 50%
    drop overnight &mdash; the decline here is continuous. But it is not uniformly gentle. The first months are the
    steepest.</p>

  <div class="fig">PHASE 3 REWARD SCHEDULE

    Time from Phase 3 start | Reward (KOT)
    ------------------------+-------------
    Block 0 (start) | 1.000
    1 week | 0.075
    1 month | 0.065
    3 months | 0.059
    6 months | 0.056
    1 year | 0.053
    2 years | 0.050
    5 years | 0.047
    10 years | 0.045
    50 years | 0.041

  <p class="fig-caption">Fig. 4 &mdash; Phase 3 reward schedule. Decline is steepest in the first months; the curve
    flattens dramatically by year 2.</p>

  <p>The total supply never reaches a hard cap, but for all practical purposes it converges. Going from year 50 to year
    100 adds fewer than 200,000 KOT. The effective supply is finite in any human-relevant timeframe. Supply figures
    represent block reward issuance. The referral system mints an additional 5% of each block reward where a qualifying
    referral is active; at full referral participation, total supply is approximately 5% higher than the base projection
    figures.</p>

    just as satoshis do for Bitcoin today.</p>


  <!-- ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
     8. LIGHT NODES
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">8.</span>Light Nodes</h2>

  <p>After ten years of operation, the full chain might reach 260 GB. Not every machine will store that.</p>

  <p>Light nodes store only block headers &mdash; 148 bytes each. Ten years of headers is approximately 77 megabytes.
    Any device can hold this.</p>

  <p>To verify a transaction, the light node requests a Merkle proof from a full node. The proof shows that the
    transaction's hash is included in the Merkle tree whose root is in a valid block header. The light node verifies the
    proof independently using only the headers it already has.</p>

  <p>This is Simplified Payment Verification, as described in Section 8 of the Bitcoin whitepaper. It works. We use it
    without modification.</p>

  <p>Light nodes can also mine. They receive the latest block template from a full node, perform the PONC puzzle
    locally, and submit valid blocks back. A light node does not need the entire chain to contribute work to the
    network.</p>


  <!-- ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
     9. STATE CHANNELS (LAYER 2)
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">9.</span>Future Work (Phase 2)</h2>

  <p>For everyday payments, Layer 1 is slow by design. Six transactions per minute across the entire network is a
    settlement system. High-frequency payments require off-chain scaling.</p>

  <p>Knotcoin Phase 2 will introduce Bilateral State Channels. Two parties will lock KOT into a shared transaction, then
    exchange signed balance updates peer-to-peer. These updates are instant, free, and unlimited in frequency.</p>

  <div class="fig">STATE CHANNEL LIFECYCLE

    Alice: 100 KOT Bob: 50 KOT
    | |
    +---- Open Channel (on-chain) -----+
    | Lock: Alice 100, Bob 50 |
    | |
    +-- Payment: Alice &rarr; Bob 10 --------+ (off-chain)

    +---- Close Channel (on-chain) -----+
    | Final: Alice 75, Bob 75 |
    | |
    Alice: 75 KOT Bob: 75 KOT</div>
  <p class="fig-caption">Fig. 6 &mdash; Only the open and close touch the blockchain. Everything in between is instant
    and free.</p>

  <p>Knotcoin v2 state channels are planned as bilateral payment channels. HTLC routing and a full multi-hop payment
    network are under research for subsequent versions.</p>

  <p>If one party tries to cheat by submitting an old state, the other party has 288 blocks (approximately 4.8 hours) to
    submit the newer, correct state. The chain always accepts the state with the higher sequence number.</p>

  <p>Priority dispute inclusion is planned for a future release. The protocol will support dispute counter-submissions
    without requiring special fees, but the reserved-slot mechanism is not part of mainnet at launch.</p>

  <p>Channels have a maximum lifetime set at creation. This prevents funds from being locked permanently if a
    participant disappears.</p>


  <!-- ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
     10. NETWORK GROWTH INCENTIVE
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">10.</span>Network Growth Incentive</h2>

  <p>A payment network without users is worthless. Bitcoin had no built-in mechanism for network growth &mdash; it
    relied entirely on external interest. That worked, but it was not designed. Knotcoin includes a direct
    protocol-level incentive for growth: the referral reward.</p>

  <h3>10.1 How It Works</h3>

  <p>When a new wallet makes its first outbound transaction, it may include a referrer's address in a registration
    field. This is a one-time, permanent, on-chain record stored in account state. When the referred miner produces a
    block, the protocol mints an additional 5% of the block reward and credits it to their referrer. This bonus is
    freshly minted &mdash; the miner's own reward is never reduced. Everyone receives what they earned. The referrer
    receives a bonus on top.</p>

  <p><strong>The referral bonus applies to all block rewards, regardless of size.</strong> Whether the reward is 1.0 KOT in Phase 2 or 0.001 KOT in Phase 3 (year 50+), the 5% bonus continues to function. This ensures the network growth incentive remains active throughout the entire emission schedule, even as individual rewards asymptotically approach zero.</p>

  <h3>10.2 The Rules</h3>

  <ol type="a">
    <li><em>Single-hop only.</em> If Alice referred Bob, and Bob referred Carol, Alice earns a bonus from Bob's mining.
      Alice earns nothing from Carol. There is no chain. There is no pyramid.</li>

    <li><em>Active mining required.</em> The referrer must have mined at least one block in the last 2,880 blocks
      (approximately 48 hours) to receive bonuses. If the referrer stops mining, bonuses stop until they resume. The
      window is 48 hours rather than 24 because at moderate network sizes each miner produces roughly one to two blocks
      per day on average; Poisson statistics give a legitimately active miner a substantial chance of a zero-block
      24-hour window through pure bad luck. The longer window keeps the bonus interrupted only by genuine inactivity,
      not by statistical variance.</li>

    <li><em>One referrer per address.</em> Set in the first outbound transaction, never changed.</li>

    <li><em>Mutual referrals permitted.</em> Two users may each set the other as referrer. This results in each miner
      receiving a 5% bonus from the other's blocks &mdash; paid by protocol minting, not by either miner. Since any two
      users can do this, it creates no systemic advantage. It is tolerated by design.</li>

    <li><em>Self-referral not permitted.</em> A referrer address must be different from the sender address. This
      prevents trivial bonus looping and keeps the growth incentive tied to genuine peer-to-peer introductions.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>10.3 Why This Is Not MLM</h3>

  <p>Multi-level marketing structures extract value upward through unlimited depth. Someone at the top of a pyramid
    earns from everyone below them.</p>

  <p>Knotcoin's referral has exactly one level. There is no top and no bottom. There are only pairs: one referrer, one
    miner. The referrer's bonus comes from the protocol treasury, not from the miner's pocket. A person who referred 100
    active miners earns a 5% bonus from each. A person who referred 1 earns from that 1. Neither earns anything from
    referrals made by people they referred. The structure is completely flat.</p>

  <h3>10.4 The Bootstrap Effect</h3>

  <p>The referral link doubles as a network bootstrap mechanism. It encodes the referrer's node address, so clicking a
    referral link simultaneously registers the referral and connects the new user to their first peer. From that peer,
    the new node discovers others. No central server needed. The network builds itself through human sharing. Every link
    is an entry point. Every person is a server.</p>


  <!-- ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
     11. GOVERNANCE
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">11.</span>Governance</h2>

  <p>The hardest question in protocol design is not what the rules should be, but who gets to change them. Knotcoin's
    answer: almost nobody, almost never.</p>

  <h3>11.1 Eternal Rules</h3>

  <p>The following properties are fixed at genesis. No vote, no majority, no software update can change them. Every node
    enforces them independently and rejects any block that violates them, regardless of chain length or hashpower behind
    it.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Dilithium for signatures</li>
    <li>SHA-512 for addresses; SHA3-256 for proof-of-work</li>
    <li>The PONC puzzle specification</li>
    <li>The emission formula (all three phases)</li>
    <li>Single-hop referral only; no multi-level structure</li>
    <li>5% maximum referral bonus</li>
    <li>No pre-mine</li>
    <li>Minimum block size: 50 KB</li>
    <li>Target block time: 60 seconds</li>
    <li>Minimum transaction fee: 1 knot</li>
  </ol>

  <p>These are non-negotiable because they define what Knotcoin is. Changing them would create a different system. If
    the community wants a different system, they are welcome to fork the code. That is not a crisis &mdash; it is the
    mechanism.</p>

  <h3>11.2 Tunable Parameters</h3>

  <p>A small set of operational parameters can be adjusted by governance vote to allow the network to adapt without requiring hard forks:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Block size ceiling</strong> (range 50 KB to 500 KB)</li>
    <li><strong>PONC round count</strong> (range 256 to 2048 rounds, default 512) &mdash; allows the network to increase computational difficulty as hardware becomes faster, maintaining memory-hard properties</li>
    <li><strong>Mining thread cap</strong> (range 1 to 8, default 4) &mdash; a fairness control to limit hardware arms races</li>
    <li><strong>Governance cap</strong> (range 5% to 20%, default 10%) &mdash; the maximum voting weight any single entity can hold. Can be lowered to 5% as the network grows to increase decentralization</li>
    <li><strong>State channel dispute window length</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Active mining window length</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Recommended fee levels</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Peer discovery configuration</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Changes require a simple majority (51%) of eligible governance weight and take effect after a 1,000-block delay to give all nodes time to update.</p>

  <h3>11.3 The Hash Escape Hatch</h3>

  <p>One exception to eternal immutability: the hash functions underlying the system can be upgraded. This requires two
    conditions: a 75% supermajority of governance weight voting in favour, and a mandatory 18-month transition period
    following the vote. During transition, both old and new hash functions are accepted. After transition, only the new
    one.</p>

  <p>This escape hatch exists because "forever" is a very long time, and hash function security is ultimately an
    empirical property. SHA-512 and SHA3-256 are strong today. The system should be able to adapt its foundation without
    requiring anyone's permission or presence.</p>

  <p>The escape hatch covers planned, orderly deprecation of a weakening algorithm. A sudden, practical break of either
    hash function &mdash; allowing forgery within hours &mdash; cannot be addressed through a governance vote; it would
    require an emergency hard fork coordinated by the developer and node operator community, the same response any
    proof-of-work blockchain would require.</p>

  <h3>11.4 Who Governs</h3>

  <p>Governance weight is stored on-chain per account and derived from recorded on-chain contribution, using a
    logarithmic scale to dampen concentration. For miners, weight increases with total blocks mined. For referrers,
    weight increases with total referred miners. The function is discrete and simple:
    <code>100 + 100 * (digits(total) - 1)</code>, so 1&ndash;9 yields 100 bps, 10&ndash;99 yields 200 bps, 100&ndash;999
    yields 300 bps, and so on. The governance cap (default 10%, tunable 5&ndash;20%) is enforced on-chain.</p>

  <p>To mathematically prevent any single industrial mining entity from monopolising the protocol, <strong>a tunable
      governance cap (default 10%, range 5-20%)</strong> is strictly enforced. Even if a massive datacenter controls 40% of the
    network hash rate and produces 40% of the blocks, their influence is capped at the governance limit during any vote.
    At the default 10% cap, this guarantees that at least six independent entities must achieve consensus to alter the network's tunable
    parameters, protecting the decentralised ethos. As the network grows, the cap can be lowered via governance vote to 5%, requiring
    eleven independent entities for consensus, further strengthening decentralization.</p>

  <p>This allocates governance weight by provable participation. It is not coin-weighted proof-of-stake; it is
    contribution-weighted proof-of-work plus referrals. Weight grows only through recorded on-chain activity and is
    bounded by the governance cap, so no single miner or referrer can dominate a vote even if they produce a large share
    of blocks.</p>


  <!-- ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
     12. SECURITY ANALYSIS
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">12.</span>Security Analysis</h2>

  <h3>12.1 Quantum Resistance</h3>

  <p>Dilithium3 signatures provide NIST Security Level 3 (equivalent to AES-192 or 192-bit post-quantum security).
    This exceeds the security of all classical cryptocurrencies and provides substantial margin against quantum attacks.</p>

  <p>The proof-of-work hash (SHA3-256) provides 128-bit security against quantum preimage attacks. Addresses derived
    from SHA-512 provide 256-bit quantum security against preimage attacks. Every component of Knotcoin is designed to
    be secure against both classical and quantum adversaries.</p>

  <h3>12.2 51% Attack</h3>

  <p>Identical to Bitcoin. An attacker controlling majority hashpower can rewrite recent history. The defence is
    economic: memory-hard mining means the attacker must commit real hardware and electricity. At network scale, this
    cost is prohibitive.</p>

  <p>During the bootstrapping phase &mdash; few miners, low total hashpower &mdash; the network is technically
    vulnerable. This is mitigated by the fact that an attack on a worthless network carries no economic incentive. By
    the time the network carries real value, the cost of attack should exceed the benefit. Every proof-of-work system
    ever created has relied on this same bootstrapping assumption.</p>

  <h3>12.3 Sybil Resistance</h3>

  <p>The referral system does not contribute to consensus power. A sybil attack using fake referral accounts earns the
    attacker 5% extra per fake account &mdash; but each fake account must perform real mining. The bonus is small
    relative to the cost. The attack is economically irrational. Consensus power comes purely from demonstrated
    proof-of-work.</p>

  <h3>12.4 Transaction Flood and Dispute Window Attacks</h3>

  <p>An attacker who wishes to prevent a state channel dispute transaction from landing could attempt to fill L1 by
    broadcasting spam transactions for the duration of the dispute window. The dispute priority mechanism (Section 9)
    counters this directly: one block slot per block is reserved for priority dispute transactions regardless of mempool
    conditions. An attacker cannot exclude a priority transaction from the blockchain by outbidding it with fees;
    priority status is determined by the structural properties of the transaction, not its fee.</p>

  <h3>12.5 Hash Function Diversity</h3>

  <p>SHA-512 and SHA3-256 are based on fundamentally different constructions (Merkle-Damgård vs. Keccak sponge). A
    structural weakness in one has no implication for the other. Using both families provides defence in depth.</p>


  <!-- ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
     13. PRIVACY
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">13.</span>Privacy</h2>

  <p>Knotcoin provides pseudonymity, not anonymity &mdash; the same model as Bitcoin. Addresses are not linked to
    real-world identities by the protocol. But transaction history is public. Sophisticated analysis can sometimes link
    addresses to individuals.</p>

  <p>Privacy features were deliberately excluded from the base layer. Privacy mechanisms add complexity that can harbour
    bugs, and bugs in privacy code have historically been catastrophic &mdash; inflation vulnerabilities hidden by
    cryptographic blinding, for example. The base layer should be simple and auditable. Privacy can be added at higher
    layers without risking the foundation.</p>

     15. CONCLUSION
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
  <h2><span class="section-num">15.</span>Conclusion</h2>

  <p>Knotcoin is not an attempt to replace Bitcoin. Bitcoin works. It has proven that peer-to-peer money is viable and
    that decentralised consensus can be maintained at global scale for over a decade without any central authority.</p>

  <p>Knotcoin is an attempt to answer a different question: what does digital money look like if you assume quantum
    computers will exist, ASIC manufacturing will centralise, and nobody will be around to maintain the system?</p>

  <p>The answer, we believe, is: simple.</p>

  <p>Simple cryptography &mdash; hash functions, nothing clever. Simple consensus &mdash; prove you did real work with
    real hardware. Simple incentives &mdash; mine to earn, share to grow. Simple governance &mdash; change almost
    nothing, almost never.</p>

  <p>The first block will be mined by someone with a laptop. The millionth block will be mined by someone we will never
    know. Somewhere between those two blocks, Knotcoin either becomes useful to people or it doesn't. We cannot control
    that. We can only make sure the foundation is sound enough that there is nothing stopping it.</p>

  <p>This paper and the accompanying code are released to the public domain. There is no company behind this, no venture
    funding, no token sale, no pre-mine, and no allocation. Block zero pays 0.1 KOT to whoever mines it, under the same
    rules as every block that follows.</p>

  <p>The rest is up to the network.</p>
